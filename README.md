# Upchain Frontend

To start the frontend server, install the repo, then run `npm install` and then ` node app.js`; go to `localhost:3000` to view the webpage. There are some assets, like fonts and images, that should be present in the `web/assets` folder which you should add yourself. This folder has been purposely put on the `.gitignore` list to save bandwidth.
